# Quick Car List

This is a mobile web application and API to simplify the creation of car listings for dealerships. The following is a brief outline of the screens involved in the administrator facing application, how cars will be managed and dealership information updated.

## Administrator Flow

After logging in to the application a dealer administrator is shown a list of the cars they have already input (shown in Figure 1). From this listing they can open the menu (shown in Figure 2) to switch to a vehicle management view which allows removing vehicles (shown in Figure 3) or entering the Add Vehicle Flow.
